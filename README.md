# 🧠 Text Generation using NLP (RNN, LSTM & GRU)

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project for Text Generation and Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) — specifically LSTM and GRU architectures.
The model learns from text data, processes it into sequences (n-grams), and generates new text based on learned patterns and context.

# 🚀 Features

🧹 Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization)

🧩 Sequence creation using n-grams

🧠 Model training with RNN, LSTM, and GRU

🔤 Predicts next word(s) or sentence continuation

📈 Visualizes training accuracy and loss curves

💾 Supports saving and loading trained models

# 🧠 NLP & Deep Learning Concepts Used

Text Cleaning:
Removed punctuation, stopwords, and unwanted characters.

Tokenization:
Split text into tokens (words) and converted them to numeric sequences.

Lemmatization:
Reduced words to their base (root) forms for better model understanding.

N-gram Sequence Creation:
Generated input-output pairs of text (e.g., 3-word sequences → next word prediction).

Embedding Layer:
Converts tokens into dense vector representations for learning semantic meaning.

Recurrent Layers:
Used RNN, LSTM, and GRU for context-based sequence learning.

Softmax Output:
Predicts the probability distribution of the next word.

# 🎯 Purpose

This project aims to demonstrate the power of NLP with deep learning for text prediction and creative text generation.
It’s ideal for learners who want to understand:

How RNNs process sequences

How LSTM and GRU handle long-term dependencies

How text data is preprocessed and converted into model-ready sequences

# 📚 Future Enhancements

🤖 Add Transformer-based models (like GPT or BERT)

🗣️ Train on large text corpora (Wikipedia, Books, etc.)

💬 Build an interactive UI for real-time text generation

💾 Deploy as an API using Flask or FastAPI
